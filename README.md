## How it works 
The user is asked to type the prefered language as written on the prompt

Then, he is asked to enter a country name (one of the 22 arab countries) : if he wrote it correctly >> the name is written on the map 

The game ends when the user enters all the 22 countries OR when he types 'Exit' or 'خروج' in arabic 

if he did not manage to enter all the countries then a csv file with the countries he missed will be created to revise them 

## IMPORTANT:
Make sure that pandas library is installed
